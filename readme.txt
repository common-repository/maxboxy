Manage content boxes through different panel strains. Lets see beneath.

= Strain FloatAny =
Basically, with FloatAny strain - float any content on your site. Whatever you make with inside the panel will appear as a floating content box on your WordPress Website. Create popup boxes, notifications, alerts, info bars, banners, display ads... 

= Strain InjectAny =
In essence, with InjectAny strain - inject any content on specified pages or over the whole site. Create alerts or highlighted content boxes and even dismissible notes. You can also inject CSS and JS code in predefined head and footer locations.

= Extend Synced-Patterns (Reusable blocks) =
Synced Patterns, a.k.a. "Reusable blocks" is native WordPress feature. Extend these content boxes with MaxBoxy functionality. It makes the boxes options similar to aforementioned InjectAny (MaxBoxy's content box strain), still, it's up to you to decide when is it suitable to use Synced Pattern and when InjectAny. You should visit the plugin documentation to compare the difference in detail.

= Simplicity, Performance and Design =
The big chance is you're going to like this, MaxBoxy’s interface is the same that WordPress is using for publishing posts and pages. This means that content of the panels are built with native WordPress’ blocks. This creates lightweight outcome, outputting mostly the resources your site is already using. This should produce faster page loading compared to the tools competitors provide.

= Conversion =
Set the goals inside your MaxBoxy content boxes and measure conversions. These goals can be set as click on buttons or newsletter/sign-up forms submission. So, after setting the panels, see the stats and how the visitors are engaging with your messages and action calls.

Therefore, MaxBoxy allows you to simply extend the functionality of your Website and to create floating content or injecting content box in an easy and a way you should be already familiar with. Multiple styles and functionalities are there which will help you to engage your site’s guests and will enable additional interactions for them on the site. You see, by using WordPress blocks you assemble components to form different site elements, i.e. floating menus, popup boxes, newsletter signup forms, important announcements and alerts, rotating messages. As you guess, the way you form the content, is up to you. You can get really creative by yourself or use existing patterns.
